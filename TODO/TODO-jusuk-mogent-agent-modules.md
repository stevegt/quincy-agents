Decision: Build mogent as a Go CLI with tag-based scoping, slash hierarchy, header attribute tags, grouped TOML config, and section-aware semantic diff. Design for promise grid integration but implement later.
Intent: Create a lightweight but flexible tool for managing agent prompts across repos, orgs, and people. Enable cross-org sharing via promise grid in future.
Constraints: Must work with existing AGENTS.md format. Must be simple to adopt incrementally.
Affects: tools/mogent/, AGENTS.toml, .mogent/

Decision: Edit command opens module in $EDITOR or assembled AGENTS.md. No special diff/merge on save.
Intent: Keep edit simple - use existing editor. Future versions can add merge assistance.
Constraints: Requires $EDITOR to be set.
Affects: tools/mogent/cmd/edit.go

Decision: Redesign mogent's next module model around selectable Markdown heading subtrees at any heading level, referenced by Obsidian-style `[[path#id]]` preset entries. Each selectable block uses an explicit human-authored `agent_module.id` in an HTML comment with YAML-like `agent_module:` metadata placed immediately after the heading. TOML or constructor defaults define render order unless a later explicit override is selected. Diff output compares selected block IDs plus rendered text.
Intent: Keep the authoring surface natural for Markdown and Obsidian-style browsing while avoiding fragile heading-derived or content-hash identifiers. Make files organizational containers and heading subtrees the standard selectable unit so the future selector can flatten choices without forcing every option into its own file. Preserve stable readable preset diffs and leave tags deferred until block IDs, validation, presets, ordering, and diff behavior are stable.
Constraints: Applies to the next mogent redesign before code changes. Metadata comments must be stripped from rendered `AGENTS.md`. A selected heading includes its descendant content until the next heading of the same or higher level. Whole-file selection is not a separate first-class standard; a whole-file module should be represented as a file with one selectable top-level heading. New implementation must validate missing files, missing IDs, duplicate IDs, and ambiguous references loudly instead of silently dropping content. Manual handle allocation remains a user-approved exception while `tools/mint-handle` is unavailable.
Affects: tools/mogent/internal/module/, tools/mogent/internal/assemble/, tools/mogent/internal/diff/, tools/mogent/internal/toml/, tools/mogent/cmd/, AGENTS.toml, .mogent/

Decision: Make the next dogfood iteration favor readable block-first CLI output and initialization: `mogent list` should render a tree with active/inactive markers, `mogent init` should generate block-native AGENTS.toml/module content instead of stale file/tag prompts, and this repo should use the generated AGENTS.md path as a dogfood target.
Intent: Improve day-to-day usability before adding a full TUI. Keep the POC fast and inspectable by making selected blocks obvious, making init produce immediately buildable block metadata, and using this repo's generated AGENTS.md to test the init/build path.
Constraints: This does not settle global-vs-local module storage, manual AGENTS.md drift handling, import/merge behavior, or rich diff semantics; those need a later TE because multiple plausible models remain. The output should stay plain-text friendly while allowing ANSI color where useful later.
Affects: tools/mogent/cmd/list.go, tools/mogent/cmd/init.go, AGENTS.toml, AGENTS.md, .mogent/

Decision: Extend the block-first CLI with width-aware tree output, explicit/inherited/inactive markers, init-time module discovery, simple module view/edit actions, and build validation for empty selected blocks or empty rendered output. Use `+` for explicitly selected blocks, `|` for blocks included through a selected parent subtree, and `-` for inactive blocks.
Intent: Make mogent easier to dogfood in real terminals before a full TUI exists. The list view should stay readable on narrow terminals, init should show what modules already exist instead of pretending only defaults exist, and build should surface weak outputs instead of silently writing empty or accidental files.
Constraints: Width awareness may use plain terminal width detection and truncation instead of a full layout engine. View/edit in init remains a simple prompt-driven action, not a yazi-style TUI. Function naming for this slice is locked as `terminalWidth`, `truncateToWidth`, `blockSelectionState`, `selectionMarker`, `discoverModuleSources`, `promptModuleAction`, `viewModule`, `editModule`, and `ValidateOutput`. Manual AGENTS.md drift handling remains deferred to a future TE.
Affects: tools/mogent/cmd/list.go, tools/mogent/cmd/init.go, tools/mogent/cmd/build.go, tools/mogent/internal/assemble/engine.go, tests under tools/mogent/
